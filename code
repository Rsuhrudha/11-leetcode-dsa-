11 Container with most water
Statement:-
You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).
Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.
Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.
Notice that you may not slant the container.
Example:-
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
code:-
nums=list(map(int,input().split(",")))
l=0
r=len(nums)-1
area=0
while(l<r):
  c=min(nums[l],nums[r])*(r-l)
  if area<c:
      area=c
  if nums[l]<nums[r]:
        l=l+1
  else:
        r=r-1
print(area)
